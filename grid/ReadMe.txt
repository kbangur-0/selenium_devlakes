You may need to download selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar (or the latest version) separately.
That file is not present with this repository to save space.
See: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.46.0
You can download that file directly from here: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.46/selenium-server-standalone-2.46.0.jar
Once you have downloaded the jar file, put it in this folder.
