You may need to download selenium-server-standalone-2.47.0.jar (or the latest version) separately.
That file is not present with this repository to save space.
You can download that file from here: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.47/
Once you have downloaded the jar file, put it in this folder.

More detailed info can be found here: https://theintern.github.io/intern/#selenium-grid
