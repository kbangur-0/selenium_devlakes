You may need to download selenium-server-standalone-2.47.0.jar (or the latest version) separately.
That file is not present with this repository to save space.
You can download that file from here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.47.0
Once you have downloaded the jar file, put it in this folder.
